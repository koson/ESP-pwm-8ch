# ESP-pwm-8ch
 
ESP32 based board with 8 PWM output channels.

This board is designed to be driven by an Olimex ESP32-POE or ESP32-POE-ISO module running Tasmota. To have access to more than 5 PWM channels the minimum Tasmota version is 11.0.0. If you want to use the ethernet interface you will need to compile your own binaries enabling the corresponding features.
